# AWS-CloudFormation

1. **Identify Requirements:**
   
**Understand Application Needs**:
Conduct meetings with developers, architects, and stakeholders to gather requirements.
Document the application's functional and non-functional requirements.
Identify key components and services required for the application's operation.

**List Required AWS Resources**:
Based on gathered requirements, create a list of AWS resources needed.
Example resources may include EC2 instances, RDS databases, VPC, subnets, security groups, etc.
Document dependencies between resources, such as which resources need access to others.

**Consider Dependencies**:
Analyze dependencies between AWS resources.
Ensure resources are provisioned in the correct order to satisfy dependencies.
Consider networking configurations, security groups, and access control requirements.

**Below is the code for Step 3: Server Configuration (Ansible)**:

1. Install Ansible:
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Here's an example for Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

**2. Write Ansible Playbooks**
Create Ansible playbooks to configure AWS resources. Below is an example playbook (configure_ec2.yml) to install Apache web server on EC2 instances:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Configure EC2 instances
  hosts: ec2
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      
**3. Configure Dynamic Inventory:**
Use Ansible's dynamic inventory to automatically discover AWS resources. Download the ec2.py script and ec2.ini configuration file provided by Ansible. Make sure they are executable:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini

chmod +x ec2.py

Modify ec2.ini file to include your AWS credentials:

[ec2]
regions = us-west-1
aws_access_key = your_access_key
aws_secret_key = your_secret_key

**4. Execute Playbooks:**
Run the Ansible playbook against your AWS infrastructure to apply configurations. Use the ansible-playbook command, specifying the playbook file and dynamic inventory script:

ansible-playbook -i ec2.py configure_ec2.yml

This command will execute the playbook configure_ec2.yml against EC2 instances discovered by the ec2.py dynamic inventory script. Make sure you have EC2 instances running and accessible with your AWS credentials. Adjust the playbook and inventory as per your requirements.
